    "One of the games we reviewed was very interesting where the player had to reach the wizard at the other side of the screen to get to the next level, but they had to do this before the bat reached the player, otherwise the player would explode. The explosion was a very cool feature they added. Something else they had was a black hole that the player could enter to get to the next level.\n",

Btw you can improve the game by slowing down chillguy cuz rn bro literally thinks he’s Lightning Mqueen himself\n",

In my opinion, this is a great game to start out with and could always use more puzzles to build onto it. Overall, this game is personally right up my alley and I enjoyed playing it and figuring out the puzzles with a little help from the NPCS!\n",

    "##### How we plan on improving:\n",
    "Based on the reviews we made our character slow down and are currently making the game easier for the user to understand and interact with. We made the character slow down by adjusting the animation rate. We are also planning on making a proximity function so that pressing a key will only reveal the text box if the player is in the npcs hitbox, otherwise the person playing the game can just end the game without going through the npcs."
