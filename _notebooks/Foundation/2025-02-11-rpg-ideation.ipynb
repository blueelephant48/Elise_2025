Within that, there are two attributes: gameLevels[], which contains options for which level of the game to play, and currentLevelIndex, which tracks the currently active level. There are three methods within that, start(), transitionToLevel(), which can help you switch levels, and gameLoop(), which makes the game’s main loop run.\n",

Hitbox{} tells how large the area is that other characters can interact with.
