    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this class, I learned both of these things, and so much more that I had never even dreamed of. I was able to gain a deeper understanding of classes and methods, which I had struggled with understanding earlier, along with learning some basic Linux commands. I have even gained some confidence with presenting to others at Night at the Museum! I learned more about myself, too. \n",

    "I believe that I still need to learn more and more about coding, along with making sure to manage my time so that I keep a constant amount of work during each project. Some things that I have learned that I am good at are being able to understand necessary parts of the code to make my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons that I took this class was because I was considering pursuing a career in computer science. I want to make fun games that can make people laugh, smile, and possibly change their lives for the better. I hope that these teachings can help me do that, and I will continue to try to improve, even if I won’t be doing CSSE 2 next trimester.\n",
    "\n",

    "Overall, this trimester, I will grade myself a 0.9/1.0. I did well and was satisfied with a lot of what I did. Even so, I still believe that I could have done a lot of things better, but it is recognizing these faults that allow us to grow. I will keep this class in mind in a lot of my future decisions and won’t forget the important lessons that this class has taught me.\n"
